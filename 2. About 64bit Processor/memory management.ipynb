    "The 16-bit segment selector in the segment register is interpreted as the most significant 16 bits of a linear 20-bit address, called a segment address, of which the remaining four least significant bits are all zeros. The segment address is always added to a 16-bit offset in the instruction to yield a linear address, which is the same as physical address in this mode. For instance, the segmented address 06EFh:1234h (here the suffix \"h\" means hexadecimal) has a segment selector of 06EFh, representing a segment address of 06EF0h, to which the offset is added, yielding the linear address 06EF0h + 1234h = 08124h.\n",
